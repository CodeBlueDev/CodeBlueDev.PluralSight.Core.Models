# CodeBlueDev.PluralSight.Core.Models

A .NET library containing PluralSight domain models that can be utilized by other .NET projects.

PluralSight changed the way their API works in what we can only assume is an effort to reuse the base urls in a more dynamic way.
Once a user has logged in to the PluralSight website, the urls are sent to the client in JavaScript form.
By inspecting the source the following base urls can be found:

```js
API_LEARNER_ROOT = "//app.pluralsight.com/learner"
API_FEATURES_ROOT = "https://app.pluralsight.com/features/api"
API_CONTENT_ROOT = "https://app.pluralsight.com/learner/content"
API_USER_ROOT = "https://app.pluralsight.com/learner/user"
API_SEARCH_ROOT = "/search/proxy"
LIVEFYRE_SITE_ID = ""
ANDROID_APP_ID = "com.pluralsight"
MONOLITH_BASE_URL = "app.pluralsight.com"
```

By inspecting some of the other main.js files that are included in the HTML these base Urls are used to generate the API urls.
Their respective purposes can be gathered from the key associated to them.

```js
courses:API_LEARNER_ROOT+"/courses",
recentCourses:API_CONTENT_ROOT+"/courses/recent",
popularCourses:API_CONTENT_ROOT+"/courses/popular",
recommendedCoursesForUser:API_USER_ROOT+"/courses/recommended",
recommendedCoursesForCourse:API_CONTENT_ROOT+"/courses/:id/recommended",
course:API_LEARNER_ROOT+"/courses/:courseId",
courseExerciseFiles:API_LEARNER_ROOT+"/courses/:courseId/exercise-files",
courseTranscript:API_LEARNER_ROOT+"/courses/:courseId/transcript",
relatedCourses:API_LEARNER_ROOT+"/courses/:courseId/related",
userCourseGrants:API_LEARNER_ROOT+"/u/courses/:courseId/grants",
userCourseRating:API_LEARNER_ROOT+"/u/courses/:courseId/rating",
userCourseProgress:API_USER_ROOT+"/courses/:courseId/progress",
userHistoryV3:API_USER_ROOT+"/courses/history",
userBookmarks:API_LEARNER_ROOT+"/u/bookmarks",
userBookmarksNew:API_USER_ROOT+"/bookmarks",
userBookmark:API_LEARNER_ROOT+"/u/bookmarks/:contentId",
userChannels:API_USER_ROOT+"/channels",
userChannelContent:API_USER_ROOT+"/channels/:channelId/content",
userPlaylists:API_LEARNER_ROOT+"/u/playlists",
userPlaylistsForCourse:API_LEARNER_ROOT+"/u/courses/:courseId/playlists",
userFeatures:API_FEATURES_ROOT+"/v1/users/:userId",
userSkillPathHistory:API_USER_ROOT+"/skill-paths/history",
learningChecks:API_USER_ROOT+"/courses/:courseId/learning-checks",
courseContent:API_CONTENT_ROOT+"/courses/:courseId",
authors:API_LEARNER_ROOT+"/authors",
author:API_LEARNER_ROOT+"/authors/:authorId",
search:API_SEARCH_ROOT,
autoComplete:API_LEARNER_ROOT+"/search/auto-complete",
```

These values can also be determined somewhat by analyzing network traffic from the client and server.

In this case, the models were derived from the `courseContent:API_CONTENT_ROOT+"/courses/:courseId"` url. For the models used in this document the course url would look something like: https://app.pluralsight.com/learner/content/courses/windows-forms-best-practices.

The Transcript models were derived from the `courseTranscript:API_LEARNER_ROOT+"/courses/:courseId/transcript"` url. For the models used in this document the course url would look something like: https://app.pluralsight.com/learner/courses/windows-forms-best-practices/transcript.

To find more information about the models or their properties select an item below.
